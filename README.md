# Mal.Mentioned Website (Capstone Project)

This repository is part of my computer science and engineering learning portfolio.

It documents a group capstone project completed during the Kode with Klossy Data Science camp. For this project, I designed and developed the front-end website, integrated MySQL data pulls, and created interactive visualizations using Tableau.

## Project Overview  
The website delivers a user-friendly interactive experience presenting data insights and analytics. My contributions included:  
- Building the website layout and interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
- Integrating MySQL database queries to fetch structured data  
- Using Tableau graphs and embedding them within the website for clear data visualization  
- Collaborating with teammates on dataset preparation, visualization design, and interface usability  

## Technologies Used  
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Data layer: MySQL for structured data pulls and query management  
- Visualization: Tableau charts embedded within web pages  
- Version control: Git & GitHub for project tracking and collaboration  

## Key Features  
- Responsive web design for desktop and mobile  
- Interactive data visualizations that allow insights into underlying datasets  
- Organized project architecture to separate front-end code, data queries, and visualization embeds  
- Team-driven workflow using version control, issue tracking, and peer review  

## Learning Outcomes  
Through this capstone project I:  
- Learned how to connect front-end pages with live data sources (MySQL)  
- Developed an understanding of embedding Tableau visualizations in web environments  
- Improved collaboration skills in a team setting including data preparation, design decisions, and code review  
- Reinforced fundamentals of clean code structure, usability, and responsive web design

Feel free to explore the code, view the embedded visualizations, and review how the data flows from the database through the visual interface. I continue to update and refine the site as I deepen my data science and web development skills.
